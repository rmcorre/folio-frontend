# folio-frontend
This is the second iteration of the front-end for the folio project. The design is based on a template I found online.
There is still alot of clean-up and refactoring to do as I've been focusing on implementing basic functionality and 
presentation.

This was mostly an excercise to try to duplicate a design and to split that design into React components. 
It was also useful to learn about new features that could be added to improve the UX/UI.

Changes made from folio-frontend-old:
* Use only functional components and hooks
* Condense CSS in one place using Sass
* Minimize requests to optimize performance
