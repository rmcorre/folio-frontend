  Optimized the code base by removing unnecessary code and libraries.
  Installed animate, simplebar, and tiny-slider.

  Import simplebar in index.js.
  Removed script entry in index.html.
  Import simplebar css to customBootstrap.scss

  Import animate.compat css in customBootstrap.scss
  Removed link entry in index.html
  ## No js to Import.

  Tried importing tiny-slider in index.js.
  Didn't work because tiny-slider is used in public/assets/js/theme.min.js.
  So couldn't remove script entry in index.html
  Import tiny-slider css in customBootstrap.scss.

  ### Note: should try implementing js in theme.min.js in each corresponding component. ###
    Eg. Tiny-slider is used in the Portfolio component. Should try to 
        implement the same code in the Portfolio component. That way, I
        can add it as an import to the component and remove the script
        entry in index.html.
